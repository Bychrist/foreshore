			  <hr>
			  <p>The preschool adopts a blend of the Montessori learning curriculum, the International Preschool Curriculum (IPC) and elements of the Early Years Foundation Stage programme. The Montessori programme entails five key areas of learning, which are practical life, sensorial refinement, mathematics, language, and culture. The key focus of this programme is to teach the children these area  through play and their own innovation.</p>
			  <p>The IPC is the world leader in early childhood education and its curriculum is outcome-based, with learning areas such as numbers, size and measurement, shapes, colours, phonics, reading preparation, motor and social development, listening and speaking. </p>

			  <h2>What your child will benefit from a Crèche/Preschool</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>In our fast changing world, parents are often faced with having to make
the decision of getting a nanny, midwife, nurse, or family member to
care for their babies and toddlers. While this is good for the child,
you must also think of what your child stands to gain in a more
intentional and structured environment.</p>
			<p>It goes beyond the aesthetics of a modern day class. It’s about
offering long lasting social, economic and academic benefits for these
special ones. Studies have shown that children, including babies and
infants of 6months to 4 years benefit such things as quality
instruction, structure and social lessons.</p>
			<p>These are what your child stands to gain at TFS Crèche/Preschool.</p>
			<hr>
			<h2>Regular Schedule/Activities</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Our Crèche and preschool have structured programmes developed from the
British National Curriculum, which has been broken down into various
activities that have been tailored to meet the needs of each child and
aid development in different areas of learning. Some of these activities
include; rhymes/songs, storytelling, water play, sensorial activities
etc.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<hr>
<p>Your child has the opportunity to spend time with peers in a supervised
and safe environment. During interaction, they learn problem solving
skills, how to share and their personalities emerge as their minds grow.
It also serves as an opportunity to interact with other adults who serve
as mentors and provide positive guidance. Our care providers have been
trained to respond to children’s vocalizations, provide encouragement,
show a positive attitude and discourage negative interactions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Higher Cognitive and Academic Achievement</h2>
<hr>
<p>Studies in the United States have shown that young children have higher
cognitive and academic achievement scores as teens if they spent time in
a high-quality daycare as young children. Of the more than 1,300
children studied, over 90 percent had been in the care of someone other
than a parent before the age of 4. The study defined “high-quality”
daycare as facilities that provide extensive interaction with care
providers, support, and cognitive-boosting activities.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Smoother Transition to Nursery</h2>
<hr>
<p>Infants who start school early easily adjust to formal schooling. They
settle into routines easily and hardly experience separation anxiety.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Social and Economic Benefits for Parents</h2>
<hr>
<p>Parents experience less anxiety and fear on how their children are doing
when left with care providers in a structured environment. In other
words, you can get a job or go back to work without having to bother if
your child is safe or not.  Even for stay-at –home mums who run their
businesses from the comfort of their homes, enrolling your child in our
crèche and preschool affords you that “me” time to meet your set
goals and deadlines.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, here at TFS we have enough care and love to go round.  It’s
all about nurturing our young ones in a happy, safe and enabling
environment.</p>
